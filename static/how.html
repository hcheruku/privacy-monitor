<h1>How Privacy Monitor works ?</h1>
<br/>
<p class="static-page-text"> Privacy Monitor app listens to different service requests (like geolocation, contacts etc.) made by other apps and logs them into a database (which resides inside your phone memory). It then compares with the access limit (total number of times a specific app accessed that service) what you set or defaults what we set, for each service.
If the app excees the limit - we raise a flag and alert you that this app is getting your information more than required number of times.
</p>

<p class="static-page-text">
	You can then disable that access to the app (from Settings -> App Permissions -> (app name) --> Under Permissions section (Ask, Grant, Deny )
